"""
ViewSets are essentially just a type of class based view, that doesn't provide
any method handlers, such as `get()`, `post()`, etc... but instead has actions,
such as `list()`, `retrieve()`, `create()`, etc...

Actions are only bound to methods at the point of instantiating the views.

    user_list = UserViewSet.as_view({'get': 'list'})
    user_detail = UserViewSet.as_view({'get': 'retrieve'})

Typically, rather than instantiate views from viewsets directly, you'll
register the viewset with a router and let the URL conf be determined
automatically.

    router = DefaultRouter()
    router.register(r'users', UserViewSet, 'user')
    urlpatterns = router.urls
